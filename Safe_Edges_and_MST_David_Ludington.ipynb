        "A safe edge is a fundamental building block for a minimum spanning tree (MST). MSTs are important aspects of undirected, weighted graphs. A spanning tree of a graph is a tree that reaches every vertex in the graph, i.e., it spans the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "An undirected, weighted graph may have several spanning trees. One (or more) of them could be a *minimum* spanning tree, i.e., a tree whose path's total weight is less than that of the other spanning trees. The example below shows a graph and its edge weights, and three of its spanning trees. For each tree, we add the weights of its edges: the green tree has a total edge weight 66, the magenta 31, and the brown 71. The magenta is the minimum spanning tree of the graph.\n",

        "Let's get a bit technical: remember that a graph $G$ is a pair of two sets: a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges. For a weighted graph, we also need a function $w: E↦\\mathbb{R}$ to represent the weights. For example, in the graph above $w((0,3)) = w((3,0)) = 5$, where $(0,3)$ and $(3,0)$ are the edges between vertices $0$ and $3$.\n",

        "A spanning tree of graph $G$, denoted $T_G$ is also a graph. It has a set of vertices $V_T$ and a set of edges $E_T$. The vertices of the spanning tree are the same as the vertices of the graph: $V_T=V$. The edges of the tree are a subset of the edges of the graph: $E_T⊆E$. The tree also has a weight function $w_T: E_T ↦\\mathbb{R}$.\n",

        "At the beginning of the algorithm, each vertex of the graph is initialized as its own component with no edges between them. A component is a group of 1 or more trees. This means, initially, each node is its own single-node component. When then count the number of components and number them so we can reference what node is a part of what component. While there is more than one component left in the graph, we iterate and connect components in the most cost-effective way possible. For each component, we find the safe edge connecting it to another component. An edge is considered safe if it's the cheapest edge connecting the component to another component that is not already part of the MST. Once we've identified these cheapest edges, we add them to our evolving MST, effectively merging the corresponding components. This continues until there is only one component left and that is the MST. By exploring safe edges and selecting the cheapest ones, we gradually expand the MST while ensuring that it remains a spanning tree and has the minimum total weight.\n"
