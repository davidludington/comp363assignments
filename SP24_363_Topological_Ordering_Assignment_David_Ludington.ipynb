        "Assuming that every directed acyclic graph (*dag*) has at least one source vertex, we can prove that **every dag has a topological ordering** -- denoted as $f$. The proof is straightforward for a graph $G=(V,E)$. Assuming that $v_1$ is the source vertex of the graph, we assign it the first $f$ value: $f(v_1)=1$. Next, we remove $v_1$ and all its edges from $G$, resulting into a subgraph $G'$ which is also a dag. As such, it has at least one source vertex, let's say $v_2$. We assign the next $f$ value to $v_2$, and remove it and its edges from $G'$. The resulting subgraph $G''$ is also a dag, has a source vertex, and so on. The recursion eventually stops (when it reaches a sink vertex). As we move from subgraph to subgraph in this process, for example from $G'$ to $G''$, we eliminate the outgoing edges of $G'$'s source, i.e., its forward edges. And as we line up $v_1$, $v_2$, etc, the edges point forward.\n",
